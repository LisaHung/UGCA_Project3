       "[\"my husband and i moved from new england to austin in september. \\xa0we've been searching north and south austin for good chinese food, and we keep coming back to first wok. \\xa0\\nthe menu has the standard range of chinese items - nothing too fancy, nothing too authentic (no chicken feet or fish heads). \\xa0the prices are what i expect to pay for chinese food: \\xa0lunches are about $6 and dinners are about $8). \\xa0my husband and i can get two lunch specials for about $15 and we don't get charged for hot tea. \\xa0i'm not used to being charged for hot tea at chinese restaurants, but every other place we've tried in austin charges. \\xa0\\nthe service has been great for us. \\xa0we've never gotten delivery, but we've been very happen when we've gone in to eat. \\xa0the building doesn't have the most attractive decor, but it's neat and clean. \\xa0the food comes out fast, and the servers are friendly. \\xa0the soups, appetizers, and entrees have always been hot and fresh. \\xa0i think this will be our go-to place for chinese food.\",\n",
       " \"we called in our order and was told 15 mins. we got there in 20 and the food was coming out fresh and hot. the lady at the front had a bad look on her face and seemed annoyed. ohhh weeellllllll.... gimme my yummie food and i'll be outta your way. \\n\\nthey've got some seriously good americanized chinese food. i've tried the beef and bean sprouts, crab puffs, chicken wings, and the combination fried rice. all were very good. \\n\\nthe phone system does suck. i had to try over 5 times on different phones just to get through. \\n\\nget the attitudes and phones fixed and you'll have one of the best no frills chinese spots in south austin.\",\n",
       " \"food was absolutely terrible i'm sorry, over cooked, not sure what the meat was in the combination rice, flavourless, won't be returning\",\n",
       " \"got three items for takeout: won ton soup and two entrees off the dinner menu. everything was almost inedibly salty. :( i may give it another try, to make sure it's not a fluke, but i definitely wasn't impressed by this experience.\",\n",

       " \"this place is our local chinese food and i'm happy we found it.\\n\\nwe usually go pick up the food, as their delivery runs about 1 hour behind, but it's worth it.\\n\\nmy wife usually orders sweet and sour chicken or general tso. both are quiet delicious. i always steal some pieces.\\n\\ni usually order the fried dumplings, best in austin, and their combination noodles.\\n\\nwe have also tried their mo shu pork which is amazing.\\n\\nfinally for new year's they included chicken wings for free and now i'm obsessed with them. they are super crispy and tasty. they must marinate them with something. whatever it is, i'll take it.\",\n",

       " \"first wok has the fastest delivery in south austin. i hang up the phone and 10-15 minutes later they're knocking on my door. the portions are very generous, so we always have leftovers for the next day.\\n\\nthe jalapeno beef is wonderful. the meat is flavorful and the jalapeno slices are spicy and never over or under cooked. their hot and sour soup is the best i've ever had. egg rolls are crunchy and tasty, especially when dipped in the hot mustard they always thoughtfully include. the pork fried rice is great. my husband likes their wings. the only bad thing i've found is that the non-breaded chicken seems to be boiled, which leaves it kind of washed out and rubbery.\\n\\nthumbs up from me.\",\n",

       " \"1st wok is one of my favorite chinese restaurants. i can agree with a lot of the previous reviewers here... yes, the restaurant is on a seedy-looking corner, the interior is extremely modest and could use a coat of paint, the food is not exactly diet-friendly... but that's all beside the point. the staff has always been very friendly and attentive when i've chosen to eat there. one of the waitresses there has been known to give my 2-year old daughter a little dish of pineapple for dessert, free of charge. and when i place an order for pick-up (i live outside of their delivery area), they throw in free chicken wings. the food is, as mentioned before, not on the healthy side, but soooo good! the portions are huge (one order can last me 2 days!). try the tropical shrimp with candied walnuts. i haven't found this dish anywhere but here, and it is awesome - but have them give you the sauce on the side. the main ingredient in the sauce is mayonnaise. it's a key element, but at least this way you can control the amount that goes on it. also, the kung pao chicken is very good. i don't particularly like their egg rolls - they seem fully cooked until you bite into them, but they taste a little doughy. (update: the vegetable egg rolls are like, a zillion times better than the regular ones!) that still doesn't keep me from giving this little diamond-in-the-rough 5 stars.\",\n",
       " 'best chinese on the south side. they \"came\" from nyc (fulton st. to be exact) and brought over the deliciousness to texas. i\\'ve been eating here for about 5 years or so, never have i been disappointed. \\xa0everything i\\'ve ever had from here has been good. my go to items are the mooshu chicken,fried rice, sesame chicken, and general tso.',\n",

       " \"yelp needs to offer more stars-- this place is literally the best chinese food ever! we happened to stumble onto this joint out of sheer luck, and i've been slacking on giving them their due credit. i have ordered to-go and dined in several times and i swear it gets better and better. from the service to the food it's phenomenal.\\n\\nfirst wok's waitstaff is unlike many other's, they're genuinely nice and get your order right. try the kung pao shrimp, pork fried rice and their amazing wonton soup--you won't regret it. \\n\\nfirst wok-- will be your first choice for chinese take-out and dine it.\",\n",
       " 'i was so excited to try this place after reading and hearing so many good things. \\xa0with no plans for memorial day weekend, i decided to try it out! \\xa0i went in expecting something worse than super bowl (another chinese restaurant just southwest) but was pleasantly surprised with a nicely decorated yet dated interior. looked pretty much like an old chinese restaurant should look like in my head. \\xa0\\n\\ntwo asian women were at the counter to greet me. \\xa0the older woman (owner??) asked if i was picking up. i told her \"i still need to order, but yes :)\". i ordered the combination fried rice, triple crown, hot and sour soup and the crab puffs for dessert, all selected because of such high reviews on yelp. \\xa0the woman asked if i wanted white or fried rice with the triple crown and i told her neither since i was ordering the fried rice already. \\xa0she asked again and i said \"no thank you, i just want to try the combination fried rice but thanks\". she asked a 3rd time pointing out it was free, this time i said \"oh no. thank you, really, i\\'m good without\" while smiling so i didn\\'t seem confused. they said it would be ready in 10 minutes - how speedy!!\\n\\nwhen i came back inside (i waited outside with my dogs in the car), it was ready! \\xa0i got home and realized i was given combination noodles, not rice. \\xa0that was rather disappointing. \\xa0and after the interaction ordering, i almost feel it was done on purpose. \\xa0i\\'m trying to believe it was unintentional and i really hope so. \\xa0the food was all fine. \\xa0the crab puffs had no crab or even krab. \\xa0soup was great. \\xa0the noodles were too greasy to eat. triple crown was good but without any rice....... maybe it will be better next time.',\n",
       " 'i should have posted this a long time ago, since i have been a customer for over 5 years, but i had worked a short housekeeping job and was paid in cash that day, but went to the restroom, before i picked up my to go order. long story short, \\xa0i had the cash in another pocket and it must of fallen out in the rest room. luckily, it was found by one of the employees , and the money was waiting for me in an envelope, after several frantic hours of searching. \\xa0the food is awesome, and i wish they would move to buda. how many restaurants do you know that would be this honest?',\n",
       " '1st wok is one of those places that definitely fits under the saying \"looks can be deceiving\". i love that they are still there after this many years, and were featured in the movie suburbia along with the corner store. \\n\\nthey are reasonably priced for the quantities they serve, what i love is that i usually get the food to go and they are great at getting everything out the door as quickly and cleanly as possible. i work about 10 minutes away and my food is still piping hot when i crack open the box at work. i also love that each to-go order comes with this little bag of crispy chips that are tasty and similar to the egg roll. a nice treat while you\\'re madly shoveling chicken in your mouth on your 30 min.\\n\\ni usually replace the soups with another crispy egg roll for $0.50 more, but try the soups too when it\\'s a little cooler outside. they have a really nice egg drop soup that\\'s not too salty like other places.\\n\\nthe only thing is that 1st wok is hard to get to when driving, you have to pull a u-turn if you\\'re not going north on south 1st. kinda lame, but that\\'s about it.',\n",
