       "['i need to start off by saying that i am mexican and love mexican food and i look forward to saturday and sunday breakfast. \\xa0this past saturday i made the mistake of going back to angies for breakfast. \\xa0i had been there for lunch and although it was a lil pricey the puffy taco was good so i thought how bad can breakfast be? \\xa0well we sit down and get approached by the grouchiest woman ever...if she is the owner or front house manager she shouldn\\'t be waiting tables, she really has no business in the service industry. \\xa0she takes our order and leaves. \\xa0never brings us chips but does drop off a dollop of salsa...brings me a water because she has to make lemonade i ordered half tea half lemonade. \\xa0she brings me a tea with a drop of lemonade. \\xa0i have to add sweetner. \\xa0when i bite into my taco, the chorizo is sour. \\xa0i am mexican and eat chorizo all the time, i know what spoiled chorizo smells like, i spit it out and flag down the other waitress since ours refuses to come back to the table. \\xa0i tell her what is wrong and ask for something else. well our original waitress returns and now suddenly only speaks spanish and tells me \"why don\\'t you like th chorizo. \\xa0what\\'s wrong with it?\" \\xa0i tell her she rolls her eyes and says \"well what do you want?\" \\xa0i tell her i reordered but would like a refill on my drink. \\xa0she then says \"we charge for refills\" \\xa0you will be charged for another tea and another lemonade. \\xa0thought in my head \"correct me if i\\'m wrong but if i am being charged for a full tea and a full lemonade shouldn\\'t i have had a full tea and a full lemonade wouldn\\'t this be my other half that i just paid for?\" \\xa0i tell her please just bring me a refill. \\xa0she rolls her eyes and walks away. \\xa0my replacement taco arrives and it\\'s burned the egg is way over cooked my potatoes are burned and the bacon is raw...needless to say i don\\'t eat it. \\xa0she never came back to the table. \\xa0i decided to get up and leave at this point...my tab for two tacos of which i ate one...and one tea...$15.00...seriously angie\\'s if you want to charge high end prices for your food, you must provide the same service...i\\'ve been in the restaurant industry for 16 years in every capacity from host to general manager and this is a location that is not worth it. \\xa0their water smells like bleach...no surprise there...their floors were dirty and the rude service...i don\\'t know what happened to this restaurant but i will stick to dario\\'s or casa garcias at least there the food is awesome and the service is great. \\xa0angie\\'s you are truly a disappointment.',\n",
       " 'this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it type place. i\\'ll admit, the service is not perfect, every dish is not a masterpiece, the margaritas are not great, and yet i\\'ve been going here weekly for over 5 years because i\\'m addicted to the corn tortillas and salsa. i\\'ve not noticed any change in food quality, and on the contrary, find it consistently satisfying. \\n\\nthe unique corn tortillas, which others have described with disdain as \"thick and chewy\" are just that, and that\\'s why i love them; especially in the form of tacos, in which case they are lightly fried. if you\\'re looking for healthy: no. but if you\\'re looking for tasty: oh yeah! \\n\\nif you think the food is bland, you\\'re not using enough of the fantastic salsa, which is fresh, super spicy and full of nice veggies - just the way i like it. (occasionally, and sadly, the salsa gets slightly less hot, which angie explains is due to low availability of hot jalapenos at certain times of the year.) \\n\\nin defense of some of the nay-saying: \\n\\nyes, angie and some of her staff are not dripping with friendliness, but i find them genuine, appreciative and hardworking. a few of them are really nice! \\n\\nyes, they use american cheese, which i happen to enjoy. people - it\\'s tex-mex after all. \\n\\nyes, the weekday lunch hour is super busy. it would not be if this was really a one- or two-star establishment. tips: there are a few extra parking spaces underneath the restaurant, accessible from the alley behind. once inside, make your way past the register line into the dining room for faster seating. arriving at 11:00 or 1:00 will usually eliminate any waiting. \\n\\nyes, angie has a policy of no separate checks at the table. however, she is more than happy to separate any check at the register - however you like.',\n",
       " \"not authentic mexican food... tortillas aren't even that thick ! and enchiladas didn't have flavor ... taco was weird had yellow cheese in it and the huevos rancheros had yellow cheese in them! whereas real huevos rancheros have no yellow cheese on top! never going back again. it wasn't of my liking.\",\n",
       " \"i really enjoyed angie's. it's tough to find decent mexican/tex-mex food for a vegetarian. you'd think veggie fajitas are a norm but not every place has 'em. here i was able to get bean tacos. they do a delicious puffy style tortilla, fresh toppings and vegetarian beans and rice. score! their mexican martinis are more than i'd like to spend ($11.25) but boy they had me buzzin'. only thing i wish they did differently is offer another veggie side. every plate comes with rice and beans but when you order a bean taco plate, yeah... that's a lot of beans. nopales would be a great option! all in all, it's a great laid back atmosphere, good food and large plates. breakfast all day - on the cheap, too!\",\n",

       " \"i had to give this two stars because three said a-ok and it was not a-ok. i have lived in austin for 12 years and angie's was recommended to me on a flight returning to austin 11 years ago. i never got around to going although i have eaten at my fair share of other mom and pops and dive mexican restaurants around town. \\nlet me start with the chips and salsa. i would say they were good because the chips were airy and the green salsa was the kind i really like, so i was psyched for the entree. i ordered a combo plate of sorts that came with a taco and tostada brought out first. well the guacamole scoop on top of the tostada was ok but the cheese reminded of the commodity cheese my friends mom always served yuck. thankful i had not ordered the cheese enchiladas at that point! the taco was good although i did not know the tortilla was home made until reading it here. i liked it, thick and semi firm, kinda good, easy to eat and alot of ground meat on it. i'm kinda already stuffed from my ok so far dining experience and then the enchiladas came. i cut into them without even tasting the beans or rice yet. well, i chewed and almost spat it out. i managed to keep my face calm and the food in my mouth, but it was the worst tasted ever. almost a non taste... like nothing no flavor uck. i was done. i did not eat a bite after that. the worst enchilada i have had in my entire life! \\xa0\\ni have been a member here for 3 years reading reviews and such and never took the time to post until this experience. don't wast your time or money trying this place.\\ni wish we had just driven on up to pappadeux's for the the mahi mahi...\",\n",

       " 'austin\\'s love affair with migas (and breakfast tacos, and queso) has always seemed amusing to me. where i am from (personally speaking, maybe not true for everyone) migas are something you make at home, not typically something worth going out for. most restaurants coat their eggs with way too much cheese and using tortilla chips is cheating. but what cisco\\'s has that my kitchen does not are fresh, super-soft biscuits and a surprisingly delicious hot sauce that sets these migas apart.\\n\\nthe restaurant itself is a treat too. the front cafeteria-style room is right next to the kitchen so it\\'s like 120 degrees. not a place to escape the heat outside. but the back dining room, which feels like a legion hall from the 1950s, is cool and cozy.\\n\\ni suppose the fact that cisco\\'s has been around for half a century implies that it must be good. most \"institutions\" end up wildly overrated and undeserving of their status. yet, in atypical austin fashion, cisco\\'s has remained simple and decidedly un-hip, which may be its saving grace.',\n",

(they don\\'t have a kids menu so you can\\'t see the prices) - beyond ridiculous. i\\'ve also noticed that the vegetarian options are real limited - these are more than enough reasons to dock that one star off. \\n\\ni highly recommend sitting at the patio when the weather is nice, the inside can get a little noisy as the hours progress- especially on a friday. as long as you get here by 5pm, there\\'s virtually no wait. \\n\\nthere\\'s plenty of parking in the purple garage across the restaurant; they also offer valet parking. you can also park at the nordstrom parking lot and walk down here pretty easy. \\n\\nin a nutshell- this is the perfect happy hour destination for anyone.',\n",

       " 'amazing tacos on home made tortillas the sopes and quesadillas were so good everything taste home made \\xa0and fresh i highly recommend \\xa0it the staff is amazing and super friendly',\n",
       " \"food was super fresh and delicious. i had the lunch special, 2 tacos and rice and beans. opt out of the beans for the refried ones-you won't regret it. the pineapple on the pork taco was amazing! surprisingly, the pork was better than the classic carne asada taco. service was great too\",\n",
       " \"saw the reviews so decided to try. excellent salsa served in tiny ramekins with an equally small bowl of chips. food was good; chicken in enchiladas was not dry. slaw was tasty; had a vinegar-y dressing. got a mixed drink, too, but it had so much cheap tequila in it that i could not drink it. i couldn't taste the grapefruit or other ingredients that were supposed to be in it.\",\n",
       " 'zack was our waiter. he was a handsomely kind ninja who slyly slid in and out of presence to deliver dishes of stellar right on flavors: al pastor taco, shrimp taco, shrimp and crab relleno, refried beans, corn cake. food was exquisite and next visit i will try the duck relleno. \\n\\nambience is sexy happy and people are enjoying themselves here. \\n\\ngluten free options were excellent. just ask server. rellenos are baked not fried. yessssssssss. \\n\\nthanks zach for such a groovy experience. \\xa0you are a talented waiter.',\n",
       " \"when we arrived we put our names in for a spot for two on the upstairs patio, the hostess said about a 30-35 min wait, which we expected, so we ordered a round of drinks to sip on while we waited. i tried the mangorita which i didn't particularly love, it had an odd taste to it that i couldn't pin point. my bf on the other hand ordered the pinarita which i happily took several slurps from. i feel like we really waited maybe 20 minutes tops before they told us a table was ready, so don't lose hope if you want a spot upstairs!\\n\\nas far as the food goes, i read so many reviews online that raved about this place, but it just didn't hit the mark with us. the chips and salsa they bring out were yummy though, pretty spicy but i love me some spicy. we shared the queso as an appetizer and it was like soup, it literally poured off the chips and we made a huge mess trying to eat it. for dinner i tried the camarones a la plancha, it was fine, nothing really great or really bad about it, just seemed 'ok' and not worth $21. my bf loves duck so he was pretty stoked about the duck enmoladas.\\n\\nthe service was great, our waiter was very attentive even though the poor guy had more sweat on his face than our water glasses had condensation on them.\\n\\ni'm sure we'll be back, perhaps it was just an off day on our first try.\",\n",
       " 'the tacos are surprisingly delicious but the drinks are sub par. i ordered the carne asada tacos and the pastor tacos, both were amazing but the pastor taco was the best. i recommend \"el alma\" for tacos, it\\'s just the drinks were not too good. i ordered a top shelf margarita and i was quickly disappointed. my cousin ordered the strawberry classic and it too was just sub par, nothing spectacular.',\n",
       " \"such a cute place. the back of the restaurant is decorated with rocks to look like a cave resembling the gruta restaurant in mexico city. loved it. it takes you up some rocky steps where you can sit in the upstairs patio next to heaters and panchos and a beautiful view of the city. \\n\\nthe sopa azteca, which i got, did not taste authentic like i'm used to. though it was great it just wasn't what i was expecting and it's more of a thick tomato soup. \\n\\ni also got a gringa which was the bomb! it's a flour tortilla with beans, carne al pastor, sour cream, onions and guacamole. a must. \\n\\nthe drinks were refreshing and on point. \\n\\nexpect a looong wait time. so make sure you have a reservation to avoid the 1-2 hour wait. close to down town so it's a perfect location. will be back!\",\n",
       " 'ambiance and views were awesome. we sat outdoors, they had heating towers and provided serape blankets on all of the chairs. great experience but would say that the food was a little bland for my taste. i did, however, enjoy the lamb barbacoa taco. will return and try other things on the menu when i visit austin again.',\n",
       " \"started off with the guacamole al chipotle and it was pretty good. i enjoyed the fried tortilla chips that they gave as well. for my tacos i got the pastor and the pollo asado. both were good, but nothing special. the pastor would have been better if they used a different meat and added onions. the pollo asado's beans on the taco tasted like they were out of a can. don't get me wrong, i was satisfied. they would get a 5/5 if they used more authentic methods and authentic ingredients.\",\n",
       " \"this place was fantastic! \\xa0we were in town for acl and found this mexican restaurant close to our hotel. we ate at the bar with jenna and the faquita was a refreshing, spicy margarita. my husband had a top shelf tequila to sip. the food was also great and we ordered based on jenna's recommendations. great place for locals and people visiting.\",\n",
       " \"great food, great service, great outdoor upstairs patio. we shared the ahi ceviche that had fresh mango and so many amazing bursting flavors. we also had the blanco queso which wasn't your traditional tex-mex queso, but wasn't too salty which many quesos are to make up for lacking flavor. we each had a flaquita margarita which wasn't too sweet, but seemed like a light pour, although it could have been because we were thirsty! i preferred the perfect margarita instead. i had the crab and shrimp chile rellano but think the quesadilla app (gringas pastor) my friend got was better, although it was filled with tons of cheese, so really heavy after already eating some of the queso. my other friend got the pastor, carne asada and pollo asado tacos and she preferred the pastor, but loved them all. we had great service from zach who recommended our different dishes and drinks, was personable, attentive and funny. we watched the lightning and listened to the thunder from the rooftop and it was a great experience for three girls from socal who never get either. i would definitely return and ask for zach!\",\n",
       " \"late night dinner after flying into town. \\xa0i was staying at the hyatt up the street and heard from a local to give this place a try. \\xa0it did not disappoint. \\xa0great loaded queso as an appetizer with some tacos for my meal. \\xa0nothing crazy but at the late hour i didn't want to go overboard. \\xa0friendly service. \\xa0even though it was chilly out, i ate on the rooftop dining area which was fantastic. \\xa0heaters to keep everyone warm and if those weren't enough, each chair had a blanket. \\xa0i will defintely be back the next time i'm in austin.\",\n",
       " 'hands down my favorite mexican restaurant in austin. austin offers may different types of mexican and this is definitely fresh, a little more baja california (think black beans) and offers a lot of great seafood. their fresh ceviche is the best! \\nwe have been here so many times and i really recommend the mole pork chops, ceviche, salads, and chile rellenos - honestly you cannot go wrong trying a little of everything. \\n\\ntheir parking lot is small, but the patio and food makes it worth it!',\n",
       " 'the food was very good and we enjoyed the fresh combination of vegetables being fed up of barbecues.\\n\\nthe service was fast and dishes enjoyable, we spent a good moment.',\n",
       " 'great service, great sangria, great views, great atmosphere. the rooftop patio is very cute and a cool place to hangout. very reasonably priced menu as well as drink and appetizer specials during happy hour (3-6). you get chips and salsa when you sit down also-the salsa is delicious. tacos were amazing. sangria was amazing. overall great place.',\n",
